# sensorTile
Work-study project 

## manuals and documentation for Internet of Things
objective of the project is to create an ecosystem of devices to collect data from the monitoring of the elderly for purpose of 
early deduction in health issues

This branch will focus on taking the information from the sensors and transferring it to an external storage center
via wifi or bluetooth.

## Internet of Things & this Project
The Internet of things is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data - Wikipedia

Using the SensorTile (ST) to gather data, we want to communicate that data to the raspberry pi
